Title: MCP Repository Plan, github variant
Status: This document is a collaborative draft and can be edited by anyone.
Reviewers: Steve Traugott
Freeze date: TBD
Release date: TBD

We start the MCP series in Google Docs; this is where the bulk of the community already is.
We migrate the repository out of Google Docs and into a git repository by (date).
We MAY use gdocs2md or equivalent to do the format conversion: https://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md	
We SHOULD use a script similar to ‘gitdriver’ to export revision history for each doc:

We push a copy of the git repository to the nation-of-makers github account by (date).
We SHOULD arrange the repo such that it is editable via github’s wiki interface.
We SHOULD set up a bot to autoregister collaborators for the repository (e.g. in response to an issue or a slack channel request), rather than leave the wiki publically editable.
